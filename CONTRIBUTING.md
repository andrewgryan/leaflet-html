# Contributing
Thank you for expressing an interest in contributing.
Leaflet HTML aspires to be the glue code between Leaflet and HTML frameworks.

Because it is a small project we have a few guidelines to follow to make life easier.

## ðŸ’¡ Issues

1. Issues are a great place to propose new features. Keep in mind the goal is to provide a lightweight wrapper for Leaflet JS.
2. Search the issues before proposing a feature to see if it is already under discussion.
3. If you see an existing issue related to your proposal, give it a thumbs up. It helps with prioritisation.
4. Feel free to open a new issue if nothing matches your idea, bug or feature request.
5. Want to contribute but don't know where to start? Look for issues with the "help wanted" tag.

## ðŸ™Œ Pull requests
1. Pull requests are welcome.
2. Fork the repository into your own account/organisation.
3. Create a branch to develop your patch/feature.
4. Submit your branch for review.

## ðŸ“– Miscellaneous
Help is appreciated to support this idea.
The goal is to find a simple, ergonomic, efficient and compact library that unleashes the power of Leaflet JS.
