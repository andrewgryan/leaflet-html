title = "Styling leaflet objects"
+++

## Naming convention
Leaflet styles objects using the `style` keyword option.
Leaflet HTML, on the other hand, needs to support inline style and leaflet style.
Therefore, the keyword `l-style` is used to style the underlying leaflet objects.

## Example

```html
<l-marker l-style='{"color": "hotpink"}'></l-marker>
```
